1. Gather application requirements and features
2. Divide the application into pages
   - Think aobut the overall and page-level UI
   - Break down the desired UI into components
   - Design and build a static version (no state yet)

   - Think about the state management and the data flow
4. Decide on what libraries to use (technology decisions)
